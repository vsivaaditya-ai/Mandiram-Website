  <h1>🌸 About Our Dhyanamandiram 🌸</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      This sacred DhyanaMandiram stands as a beacon of devotion, meditation, and eternal blessings 
      in the holy presence of <span class="highlight">Shirdi Saibaba</span> and 
      <span class="highlight">Lord Dattatreya</span>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      It was lovingly inaugurated on <span class="highlight">9th October 2019</span>, in the cherished memory of 
      <span class="highlight">Smt. Sathiraju Lakshmi Devi</span> & 
      <span class="highlight">Sri Sathiraju Narasimha Murthy</span>, who are devoted followers of Baba. 
      The divine seed of this Mandiram was sown in the heart of their son, 
      <span class="highlight">Sathiraju Srinivas</span>, who, while living in the United States, 
      felt a deep calling to build a place of worship for Baba. Though he first considered building it abroad, 
      destiny guided the vision differently. 
    </p>

    <p>
      When Srinivas shared his thought with his sister <span class="highlight">Sathiraju Annapurna</span> 
      both were unsure of the right place to establish such a holy space.
      With a prayerful heart, <span class="highlight">Annapurna</span> went to Shirdi. 
      In Baba’s holy presence, she prepared chits with place names, placed them reverently at Baba’s feet, 
      and prayed for guidance. When she picked one, it bore the name 
      <span class="highlight">Ganganapally</span> 🌸 — Baba’s chosen abode.  
    </p>

    <p>
      With great joy, their elder sister <span class="highlight">Sathiraju Vijaya Kumari</span> offered her 
      land at Ganganapally for the construction. From that divine moment, the family united in devotion.  
      <span class="highlight">Annapurna</span> and her eldest sister <span class="highlight">Sathiraju Venkata Kameswari's</span> 
      son <span class="highlight">Siva Aditya Venneti</span> who are also devotees of Baba
      poured their efforts and love into building this holy place, which is maintained entirely by the family. 
    </p>

    <p>
      On <span class="highlight">14th December 2024</span>, another chapter of grace unfolded 🌺. 
      The <span class="highlight">Dattatreya Dhyanamandiram</span> was consecrated on the top floor of the Mandiram.  
      Lord Dattatreya — revered as the eternal Guru and guiding light of Shirdi Saibaba — now blesses devotees 
      with wisdom, peace, and spiritual strength.  
    </p>

    <p class="symbols">🕉️ Shraddha (Faith) & Saburi (Patience) 🙏</p>
    <p>
      Today, this Mandiram is not just a place of worship; it is a living testimony of 
      <span class="highlight">Shraddha</span> and <span class="highlight">Saburi</span>, guiding every soul who enters 
      towards inner peace, devotion, and divine grace. 🌸
